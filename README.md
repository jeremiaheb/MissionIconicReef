# M:IR RVC Analysis

### The Data

Sites at MIR locations, “inside”, were compared to sites in the rest of
the Florida Keys. Since MIR sites only comprised of stratum FK01-FK05,
FK06-FK09 were removed from the “outside” data set. (Files containing the data 
used are inside of the "data" folder)

## Documents

The folder labeled "docs" contains "Index.qmd", a quarto document, which is used to generate both the 
HTML and the PDF outputs. 
The sub-folder "code" contains .R files for functions used in the analysis.


## Editing the .qmd

After making edits to the .qmd, be sure to render the PDF before rendering the 
HTML so that the PDF button on the HTML page contains any updates made to the file.
