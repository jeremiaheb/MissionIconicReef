## Introduction

[Mission: Iconic Reefs](https://missioniconicreefs.org/) is a multi-institutional initiative designed to restore ecological function and biodiversity across key reef sites in the Florida Keys. Led by NOAA in collaboration with federal, state, institutional, and non-profit partners, M:IR targets nearly three million square feet of reef at seven key coral reefs in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS): Carysfort (North and South), Cheeca Rocks, Eastern Dry Rocks, Horseshoe Reef, Looe Key, Newfound Harbor, and Sombrero Reef.. The overarching M:IR goal is to restore coral cover and reef function to a self-sustaining state.

Monitoring the response of reef fish populations to these restoration interventions is essential to quantify the broader ecological impacts of restoration efforts [@Feeley2025]. The National Coral Reef Monitoring Program (NCRMP) conducts non-extractive Reef Visual Census (RVC) surveys using a stationary-point-count method modified from Bohnsack and Bannerot (1986) [@Bohnsack86; @CRCP2024]. Surveys are conducted on shallow (\<30 m), hard-bottom reef habitats and employ a stratified-random, one-stage design within 50 m × 50 m grid cells to ensure representative sampling across depth and rugosity strata [@CRCP2024; @Ault2021]. For this analysis, the NCRMP dataset was restricted to strata types overlapping M:IR sites to allow direct comparisons of fish communities inside and outside restoration areas.

Six reef fish species were selected to represent a range of trophic levels and functional roles. NCRMP’s extensive sampling provides population-level insights into density (number of individuals per 177 m$^{2}$ ± SE), occurrence (frequency of detection within and outside M:IR sites ± SE), and relative length frequency distributions. Density and occurrence metrics enable detection of shifts in abundance and distribution patterns in response to environmental disturbances and management interventions [@Ault2021]. Length frequency data provide detailed information on population structure, recruitment, and potential fishing impacts, serving as an indicator of restoration effectiveness and long-term population sustainability [@Ault2021]. Analysis was completed using the Blondeau & Ganz RVC Statistics package in R [@Ganz2015]

## Data

To allow for direct comparisons of fish populations inside the M:IR restoration areas with control, non-restored areas across the Florida Keys reefs, the NCRMP dataset was restricted to strata types and depth zones (0-12 m) found within M:IR sites (table 1). Standard fish metrics, including density, occurrence, and relative length composition, are for selected fish species (table 2). Computational formulas of standard metrics for a single-stage stratified random sampling design are modified from Smith et al. (2011b) and provided in detail in Grove et al. (2021) and Bryan et al. (2016). Statistical comparisons evaluated density and occurrence differences between M:IR and NCRMP estimates for each survey year. This report focuses on coral populations and benthic community metrics; a separate report can be found for fish population assessments [Krampitz et al., 2025](https://nkrampitz.github.io/MIR-Krampitz/#introduction). Fish analysis scripts are open source and available through the [NCRMP Fish R package](https://github.com/jeremiaheb/rvc) (Ganz and Blondeau 2015).

### Strata

```{r echo=FALSE}
render_strata_table(MIR_data$sample_data, caption = "Table 1: Number of reef fish survey sites inside and outside M:IR areas in each stratum by year.")
```

\newpage

### Fish Species

```{r echo=FALSE}
# To add species to the document, add species code here
target_species <- c(
  "HAE FLAV", "SPA VIRI", "SCA GUAC", "STE PLAN",
  "CAL CALA", "CAL NODO", "EPI MORI"
  # , "EPI ITAJ"
  # # "THA BIFA", "HAL GARN", "STE LEUC", "SPA AURO",
  # "ABU SAXA", "HAE SCIU", "OCY CHRY", "LUT GRIS"
)

# Build spp_list dynamically with image paths for later use in tables/plots

spp_list <- MIR_data$taxonomic_data %>%
  filter(SPECIES_CD %in% target_species) %>%
  select(SPECIES_CD, COMNAME, SCINAME) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  arrange(match(SPECIES_CD, target_species)) %>%
  left_join(community_data) %>%
  mutate(
    COMNAME = stringr::str_to_title(COMNAME),
    img_path = file.path("species_photos", paste0(gsub(" ", "_", SPECIES_CD), ".png"))
  )

render_species_table(spp_list, caption = "Table 2: Fish species with representative photos. For analysis, both porgy species were combined.")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#Merging species for analysis. Repeat chunk for merging other species 
MIR_data_merged <- MIR_data
MIR_data_merged$sample_data <- MIR_data$sample_data %>%
  mutate(SPECIES_CD = ifelse(SPECIES_CD %in% c("CAL CALA", "CAL NODO"), "CAL CALA", SPECIES_CD))

#creating spp_list_merged for plots with merged species data. 
#spp_list is still used in table to show original species information
spp_list_merged <- spp_list %>%
  mutate(
    COMNAME = ifelse(SPECIES_CD %in% c("CAL CALA", "CAL NODO"), "Porgy", COMNAME),
    SPECIES_CD = ifelse(SPECIES_CD %in% c("CAL CALA", "CAL NODO"), "CAL CALA", SPECIES_CD),
    SCINAME = ifelse(SPECIES_CD == "CAL CALA", "Calamus spp.", SCINAME) 
  ) %>%
  distinct(SPECIES_CD, COMNAME, SCINAME, .keep_all = TRUE)
  
```

## Density

NCRMP’s comprehensive sampling design provides a broad, population-level perspective on the status and trends of the reef fish community. In particular, trend data can provide insight into how species respond to events including regional management actions such as targeted coral restoration efforts within the M:IR sites. Density results are shown as the number of individuals per survey area 177 m$^{2}$ ± SE.

```{r, fig.width=12, fig.height=8, echo=FALSE}
MIR_domain_dens_by_year(MIR_data_merged, spp_list_merged)
```

\newpage

## Occurrence

Occurrence measures how often a species is detected in surveys, providing insight into its distribution within M:IR sites and outside of M:IR sites in the Florida Keys. Results show presence regardless of abundance, helping to identify widespread versus rare species. Survey occurrence results are shown within M:IR sites (inside) and in the Florida Keys (outside) ± SE.

```{r, fig.width=12, fig.height=8, echo=FALSE}
MIR_domain_occ_by_year(MIR_data_merged, spp_list_merged)
```

\newpage

## Relative Length Frequency

Length compositions provide a detailed description of a selected fish’s population structure. These highly informative figures can show the length at which a fish species recruits to the coral reef (i.e., young of year or from nursery habitat), length classes removed by the local fisheries, and the effectiveness of management actions

::: panel-tabset
```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis', fig.width=12, fig.height=10}
#Length frequency plots
pwalk(
  spp_list_merged,
  function(SPECIES_CD, COMNAME, SCINAME, max_size, ...) {
    cat("### ", COMNAME, "\n\n")
    p <- render_LF_plots(
      df         = MIR_data_merged,   
      SPECIES_CD = SPECIES_CD,
      COMNAME    = COMNAME,
      max_size   = max_size,
      yrs        = unique(MIR_data_merged$sample_data$YEAR),
      target_bins = 10
    )
    print(p)
    cat("\n\n")
  }
)
